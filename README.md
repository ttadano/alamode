## Introduction 

ALAMODE is a scientific software designed for analyzing lattice anharmonicity
and lattice thermal conductivity of solids. By using an external DFT package
such as VASP and Quantum ESPRESSO, you can extract harmonic and anharmonic
force constants straightforwardly with ALAMODE. Using the calculated anharmonic
force constants, you can also estimate lattice thermal conductivity, phonon
linewidth, and other anharmonic phonon properties from first principles.

## Features


### General
* Extraction of harmonic and anharmonic force constants based on the supercell approach
* Applicable to any crystal structures and low-dimensional systems
* Accurate treatment of translational and rotational invariance
* Interface to VASP, Quantum-ESPRESSO, OpenMX, xTAPP, and LAMMPS codes
* Parallelization with MPI+OpenMP

### Harmonic properties

* Phonon dispersion
* Phonon DOS, atom-projected phonon DOS
* Two-phonon DOS
* Vibrational thermodynamic functions (heat capacity, entropy, free energy)
* Mean-square displacement
* Animation and visualization of phonon modes (requires VMD or XCrysDen)
* 3-phonon scattering phase space
* Phonon-isotope scattering rate
* Participation ratio for analyzing the localization of phonon modes


### Anharmonic properties
* Gruneisen parameter via cubic force constants
* Lattice thermal conductivity by BTE-RTA
* Cumulative thermal conductivity
* Phonon linewidth due to 3-phonon interactions
* Phonon frequency shift due to 3- and 4-phonon interactions
* Temperature-dependent effective potential method
* Self-consistent phonon calculation

## Prerequisite
* C++ compiler
* LAPACK library
* MPI library
* Boost C++ library
* FFT library
* Eigen3 library
* spglib
