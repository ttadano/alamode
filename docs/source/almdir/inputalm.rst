ALM: Input files 
----------------

.. _reference_input_alm:

Format of input files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each input file should consist of entry fields.
Available entry fields are 

**&general**, **&interaction**, **&cutoff**, **&cell**, **&position**, and **&optimize** (**&fitting**).


Each entry field starts from the key label **&field** and ends at the terminate character "/". (This is equivalent to Fortran namelist.) 

For example, &general entry field of program *alm* should be given like

::

  &general
    # Comment line
    PREFIX = prefix
    MODE = fitting
  /

Multiple entries can be put in a single line. Also, characters put on the right of sharp (“#”) are neglected. Therefore, the above example is equivalent to the following::
  
  &general
    PREFIX = prefix; MODE = fitting  # Comment line
  /

Each variable must be given inside the appropriate entry field.

 :Default: None
 :Type: Array of strings
 :Example: In the case of GaAs with ``NKD = 2``, it should be ``KD = Ga As``.

"&interaction"-field
++++++++++++++++++++

.. _alm_norder:


* **NORDER**-tag : The order of force constants to be calculated. Anharmonic terms up to :math:`(m+1)`\ th order will be considered with ``NORDER`` = :math:`m`.

 :Default: None
 :Type: Integer
 :Example: ``NORDER = 1`` for calculate harmonic terms only, ``NORDER = 2`` to include cubic terms as well, and so on.

````

.. _alm_nbody:


* NBODY-tag : Entry for excluding multiple-body interactions from anharmonic force constants
 
 :Default: ``NBODY`` = [2, 3, 4, ..., ``NORDER`` + 1]
 :Type: Array of integers
 :Description: This tag may be useful for excluding multi-body clusters which are supposedly less important. For example, a set of fourth-order IFCs :math:`\{\Phi_{ijkl}\}`, where :math:`i, j, k`, and :math:`l` label atoms in the supercell, can be categorized into four different subsets; **on-site**, **two-body**, **three-body**, and **four-body** terms. Neglecting the Cartesian coordinates of IFCs for simplicity, each subset contains the IFC elements shown as follows:

    =========== =========================================================================
     on-site    | :math:`\{\Phi_{iiii}\}`
     two-body   | :math:`\{\Phi_{iijj}\}`, :math:`\{\Phi_{iiij}\}` (:math:`i\neq j`)
     three-body | :math:`\{\Phi_{iijk}\}` (:math:`i\neq j, i\neq k, j \neq k`)
     four-body  | :math:`\{\Phi_{ijkl}\}` (all subscripts are different from each other)
    =========== =========================================================================    

    Since the four-body clusters are expected to be less important than the three-body and less-body clusters, you may want to exclude the four-body terms from the Taylor expansion potential because the number of such terms is huge. This can be done by setting the ``NBODY`` tag as ``NBODY = 2 3 3`` together with ``NORDER = 3``.

 :More examples: ``NORDER = 2; NBODY = 2 2`` includes harmonic and cubic IFCs but excludes three-body clusters from the cubic terms.

                 ``NORDER = 5; NBODY = 2 3 3 2 2`` includes anharmonic terms up to the sixth-order, where the four-body clusters are excluded from the fourth-order IFCs, and the multi (:math:`\geq 3`)-body clusters are excluded from the fifth- and sixth-order IFCs.

````

"&cutoff"-field
+++++++++++++++

In this entry field, one needs to specify cutoff radii of interaction for each order in units of Bohr. 
In the current implementation, cutoff radii should be defined for every possible pair of atomic elements. 
For example, the cutoff entry for a harmonic calculation (``NORDER = 1``) of Si (``NKD = 1``) should be like
::

 &cutoff
  Si-Si 10.0
 /

This means that the cutoff radius of 10 :math:`a_{0}` is used for harmonic Si-Si terms. 
Please note that the first column should be two character strings, which are contained in the ``KD``-tag, 
connected by a hyphen (’-’). 

When one wants to consider cubic terms (``NORDER = 2``), please specify the cutoff radius for cubic terms in the third column as the following::

 
 &cutoff
  Si-Si 10.0 5.6 # Pair r_{2} r_{3}
 /

Instead of giving specific cutoff radii, one can write "None" as follows::

 &cutoff
  Si-Si None 5.6
 /

which means that all possible harmonic terms between Si-Si atoms will be included. 

.. caution::

  Setting 'None' for anharmonic terms can greatly increase the number of parameters and thereby increase the computational cost.

When there are more than two atomic elements, please specify the cutoff radii between every possible pair of atomic elements. In the case of MgO (``NKD = 2``), the cutoff entry should be like
::
 
 &cutoff
  Mg-Mg 8.0
  O-O 8.0
  Mg-O 10.0
 /

which can equivalently be written by using the wild card (’*’) as
::

 &cutoff
  *-* 8.0
  Mg-O 10.0 # Overwrite the cutoff radius for Mg-O harmonic interactions
 /

.. important::

  Cutoff radii specified by an earlier entry are overwritten by a new entry that comes later.

Once the cutoff radii are properly given, harmonic force constants
:math:`\Phi_{i,j}^{\mu,\nu}` satisfying :math:`r_{ij} \le r_{c}^{\mathrm{KD}[i]-\mathrm{KD}[j]}` will be searched.

In the case of cubic terms, force constants :math:`\Phi_{ijk}^{\mu\nu\lambda}` satisfying :math:`r_{ij} \le r_{c}^{\mathrm{KD}[i]-\mathrm{KD}[j]}`, :math:`r_{ik} \le r_{c}^{\mathrm{KD}[i]-\mathrm{KD}[k]}`, and
:math:`r_{jk} \le r_{c}^{\mathrm{KD}[j]-\mathrm{KD}[k]}` will be searched and determined by fitting.

````

"&cell"-field
+++++++++++++

Please give the cell parameters in this entry in units of Bohr as the following::

 &cell
  a
  a11 a12 a13
  a21 a22 a23
  a31 a32 a33
 /

The cell parameters are then given by :math:`\vec{a}_{1} = a \times (a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13})`,
:math:`\vec{a}_{2} = a \times (a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23})`, and :math:`\vec{a}_{3} = a \times (a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33})`.

````

"&position"-field
+++++++++++++++++

In this field, one needs to specify the atomic element and fractional coordinate of atoms in the supercell. 
Each line should be
::

  ikd xf[1] xf[2] xf[3]

where `ikd` is an integer specifying the atomic element (`ikd` = 1, ..., ``NKD``) and `xf[i]` is the
fractional coordinate of an atom. There should be ``NAT`` such lines in the &position entry field.


````

"&optimize"-field ("&fitting"-field)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This field is necessary when ``MODE = optimize`` (or a deprecated option ``MODE = fitting``).

.. _alm_lmodel:

   "least-squares", "LS", "OLS",  1    Ordinary least square
   "elastic-net", "enet", 2            Elastic net
 =================================== ==========================

 :Default: least-squares
 :Type: String
 :Description: When ``LMODEL = ols``, the force constants are estimated from the displacement-force datasets via the ordinary least-squares (OLS), which is usually sufficient to calculate harmonic and third-order force constants. 

               The elastic net (``LMODEL = enet``) should be useful to calculate the fourth-order (and higher-order) force constants. When the elastic net is selected, the users have to set the following related tags: ``CV``, ``L1_RATIO``, ``L1_ALPHA``, ``CV_MAXALPHA``, ``CV_MINALPHA``, ``CV_NALPHA``, ``STANDARDIZE``, ``ENET_DNORM``, ``MAXITER``, ``CONV_TOL``, ``NWRITE``, ``SOLUTION_PATH``, ``DEBIAS_OLS``

.. _alm_ndata:

* NDATA-tag : Number of displacement-force data sets

 :Default: None
 :Type: Integer
 :Description: If ``NDATA`` is not given, the code reads all lines of ``DFSET`` (excluding comment lines) and estimates ``NDATA`` by dividing the line number by ``NAT``. If the number of lines is not divisible by ``NAT``, an error is raised. ``DFSET`` should contain at least ``NDATA``:math:`\times` ``NAT`` lines.

````

.. _alm_nstart:

* NSTART, NEND-tags : Specifies the range of data to be used for fitting

 :Default: ``NSTART = 1``, ``NEND = NDATA``
 :Type: Integer
 :Example: To use the data in the range of [20:30] out of 50 entries, the tags should be ``NSTART = 20`` and ``NEND = 30``.

````

.. _alm_skip:

* SKIP-tag : Specifies the range of data to be skipped for training

 :Default: None
 :Type: Two integers connected by a hyphen
 :Description: ``SKIP`` =\ :math:`i`-:math:`j` skips the data in the range of [:math:`i`:\ :math:`j`]. The :math:`i` and :math:`j` must satisfy :math:`1\leq i \leq j \leq` ``NDATA``.  This option may be useful when doing cross-validation manually (``CV=-1``).

   2   | In addition to ``ICONST = 1``, constraints for rotational invariance will be 
       | imposed up to (``NORDER`` + 1)th order. Available only when ``LMODEL = ols``.
   3   | In addition to ``ICONST = 2``, constraints for rotational invariance between (``NORDER`` + 1)th order

 :Default: 11
 :Type: Integer
 :Description: See :ref:`this page<constraint_IFC>` for the numerical formulae.

````

.. _alm_rotaxis:


* ROTAXIS-tag : Rotation axis used to estimate constraints for rotational invariance. This entry is necessary when ``ICONST = 2, 3``.

 :Default: None
 :Type: String
 :Example: When one wants to consider the rotational invariance around the :math:`x`\ -axis, one should give ``ROTAXIS = x``. If one needs additional constraints for the rotation around the :math:`y`\ -axis, ``ROTAXIS`` should be ``ROTAXIS = xy``. 

````

.. _alm_fc2xml:

* FC2XML-tag : XML file to which the harmonic terms are fixed upon fitting

 :Default: None
 :Type: String
 :Description: When ``FC2XML``-tag is given, harmonic force constants are fixed to the values stored in the ``FC2XML`` file. This may be useful for optimizing cubic and higher-order terms without changing the harmonic terms. Please make sure that the number of harmonic terms in the new computational condition is the same as that in the ``FC2XML`` file.

````

.. _alm_fc3xml:

* FC3XML-tag : XML file to which the cubic terms are fixed upon fitting

 :Default: None
 :Type: String
 :Description: Same as the ``FC2XML``-tag, but ``FC3XML`` is to fix cubic force constants. 

````

.. _alm_sparse:

* SPARSE-tag = 0 | 1

 ===== ==============================================================
   0    Use a direct solver (SVD or QRD) to estimate force constants
   1    Use a sparse solver to estimate force constants
 ===== ==============================================================

 :Default: 0
 :Type: Integer
 :Description: When you want to calculate force constants of a large system and generate training datasets by displacing only a few atoms from equilibrium positions, the resulting sensing matrix becomes large but sparse. For such matrices, a sparse solver is expected to be more efficient than SVD or QRD in terms of both memory usage and computational time. When ``SPARSE = 1`` is set, the code uses a sparse solver implemented in Eigen3 library. You can change the solver type via ``SPARSESOLVER``. Effective when ``LMODEL = ols``.

How to make a DFSET file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _label_format_DFSET:

Format of ``DFSET`` (recommended as of ver. 1.1.0)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The displacement-force data sets obtained by first-principles (or classical force-field) calculations
have to be saved to a file, say *DFSET*. Then, the force constants are estimated by setting ``DFSET =`` *DFSET* and with ``MODE = optimize``.

The *DFSET* file must contain the atomic displacements and corresponding forces in Cartesian coordinate for at least ``NDATA`` structures (displacement patterns)
in the following format: 

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    # Structure number 1 (this is just a comment line)
    \begin{eqnarray*}
     u_{x}(1) & u_{y}(1) & u_{z}(1) & f_{x}(1) & f_{y}(1) & f_{z}(1) \\
     u_{x}(2) & u_{y}(2) & u_{z}(2) & f_{x}(2) & f_{y}(2) & f_{z}(2) \\

Here, ``NAT`` is the number of atoms in the supercell. 
The unit of displacements and forces must be **Bohr** and **Ryd/Bohr**, respectively.

Format of ``DFILE`` and ``FFILE`` (deprecated)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. deprecated:: 1.1.0
   Use ``DFSET`` instead.

The displacement-force data sets obtained by first-principles (or classical force-field) calculations
have to be saved to ``DFILE`` and ``FFILE`` to estimate IFCs with ``MODE = fitting``.
In ``DFILE``, please explicitly specify the atomic displacements :math:`u_{\alpha}(\ell\kappa)` **in units of Bohr** as follows:
 
.. math::
    :nowrap:
  
    \begin{eqnarray*}
     u_{x}(1) & u_{y}(1) & u_{z}(1) \\
     u_{x}(2) & u_{y}(2) & u_{z}(2) \\
     & \vdots & \\
     u_{x}(\mathrm{NAT}) & u_{y}(\mathrm{NAT}) & u_{z}(\mathrm{NAT})
    \end{eqnarray*}

When there are ``NAT`` atoms in the supercell and ``NDATA`` data sets, 
there should be  ``NAT`` :math:`\times` ``NDATA`` lines in the ``DFILE`` without blank lines.
In ``FFILE``, please specify the corresponding atomic forces **in units of Ryd/Bohr**.
