.. _tutorial_Si_step1:

1. Get displacement patterns by **alm**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change directory to **example/Si** and open file :red:`si_alm.in`.
This file is an input for the code **alm** which estimate interatomic force constants (**IFC**) by least square fitting.
In the file, the crystal structure of a 2x2x2 conventional supercell of Si is specified in the **&cell** and the **&position** fields as the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../example/Si/si_alm.in
   :lines: 1-30

Replace the lattice constant of the supercell (20.406 Bohr) by your own value.

Then, execute **alm**
::

  $ alm si_alm.in > si_alm.log1

which creates a file :red:`si222.pattern_HARMONIC` in the working directory. 
In the pattern file, suggested displacement patterns are defined in Cartesian coordinates. 
As you can see in the file, there is only one displacement pattern for harmonic IFCs of bulk Si.


.. _tutorial_Si_step2:

2. Calculate atomic forces for the displaced configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, calculate atomic forces for all the displaced configurations defined in :red:`si222.pattern_HARMONIC`.
To do so, you first need to decide the magnitude of displacements :math:`\Delta u`, which should be small so that anharmonic contributions are negligible. In most cases, :math:`\Delta u \sim 0.01` |Angstrom| is a reasonable choice. 

Then, prepare input files necessary to run an external DFT code for each configuration.
Since this procedure is a little tiresome, we provide a subsidiary Python script for VASP, Quantum-ESPRESSO (QE), and xTAPP.
Using the script :red:`displace.py` in the tools/ directory, you can generate the necessary input files as follows:

    **QE**
    ::

        $ python displace.py --QE=si222.pw.in --mag=0.01 si222.pattern_HARMONIC

    **VASP**
    ::

        $ python displace.py --VASP=POSCAR.orig --mag=0.01 si222.pattern_HARMONIC

    **xTAPP**
    ::

        $ python displace.py --xTAPP=si222.cg --mag=0.01 si222.pattern_HARMONIC

    **OpenMX**
    ::

        $ python displace.py --OpenMX=si222.dat --mag=0.01 si222.pattern_HARMONIC

The ``--mag`` option specifies the displacement length in units of Angstrom. 
You need to specify an input file with equilibrium atomic positions either by the ``--QE``, ``--VASP``, ``--xTAPP``, ``--OpenMX`` or ``--LAMMPS``.

Then, calculate atomic forces for all the configurations. This can be done with a simple shell script 
as follows::

    #!/bin/bash

    # Assume we have 20 displaced configurations for QE [disp01.pw.in,..., disp20.pw.in].

    for ((i=1;i<=20;i++))
    do
        num=`echo $i | awk '{printf("%02d",$1)}'`
        mkdir ${num}
        cd ${num}
        cp ../disp${num}.pw.in .
        pw.x < disp${num}.pw.in > disp${num}.pw.out
        cd ../
    done

.. important::
   In QE, you need to set tprnfor=.true. to print out atomic forces. 

The next step is to collect the displacement data and force data by the Python script :red:`extract.py` (also in the tools/ directory). This script can extract atomic displacements, atomic forces, and total energies from multiple output files as follows:

    **QE**
    ::

    $ python extract.py --QE=si222.pw.in --get=disp *.pw.out > disp.dat
    $ python extract.py --QE=si222.pw.in --get=force *.pw.out > force.dat

    **VASP**
    ::

    $ python extract.py --VASP=POSCAR.orig --get=disp vasprun*.xml > disp.dat
    $ python extract.py --VASP=POSCAR.orig --get=force vasprun*.xml > force.dat

    **xTAPP**
    ::

    $ python extract.py --xTAPP=si222.cg --get=disp *.str > disp.dat
    $ python extract.py --xTAPP=si222.cg --get=force *.str > force.dat

    **OpenMX**
    ::

    $ python extract.py --OpenMX=si222.dat --get=disp *.out > disp.dat
    $ python extract.py --OpenMX=si222.dat --get=force *.out > force.dat

In the above examples, atomic displacements of all the configurations are merged as *disp.dat*, and the corresponding atomic forces are saved in the file *force.dat*. These files will be used in the following fitting procedure as ``DFILE`` and ``FFILE``. (See :ref:`Format of DFILE and FFILE<label_format_DFILE>`).


.. Note::
   For your convenience, we provide the :red:`disp.dat` and :red:`force.dat` files in the reference/ subdirectory. These files were generated by the Quantum-ESPRESSO package with ``--mag=0.02``. You can proceed to the next step by copying these files to the working directory.


.. _tutorial_Si_step3:

3. Estimate force constants by fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the file :red:`si_alm.in` to perform least-square fitting.
Change the ``MODE = suggest`` to ``MODE = fitting`` as follows::

    &general
      PREFIX = si222
      MODE = fitting   # <-- here
      NAT = 64; NKD = 1
      KD = Si
    /

Also, add the **&fitting** field as::

    &fitting
      NDATA = 1
      DFILE = disp.dat
      FFILE = force.dat
    /

Then, execute **alm** again
::

    $ alm si_alm.in > si_alm.log2

This time **alm** extract harmonic IFCs from the given displacement-force data set (disp.dat and force.dat above).

You can find files :red:`si222.fcs` and :red:`si222.xml` in the working directory.
The file :red:`si222.fcs` contains all IFCs in Rydberg atomic units.
You can find symmetrically irreducible sets of IFCs in the first part as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../example/Si/reference/si222.fcs
   :lines: 1-40

Harmonic IFCs :math:`\Phi_{\mu\nu}(i,j)` in the supercell are given in the third column
and the multiplicity :math:`P` is the number of times each interaction :math:`(i, j)` occurs within the given cutoff radius.
For example, :math:`P = 2` for the pair :math:`(1x, 2x)` because the distance :math:`r_{1,2}` is exactly the same as the distance :math:`r_{1,2'}` where the atom 2' is a neighboring image of atom 2 under the periodic boundary condition.
If you compare the magnitude of IFCs, the values in the third column should be divided by :math:`P`.

In the log file :red:`si_alm2.log`, the :ref:`fitting error<fitting_formalism>` is printed.
Try
::

  $ grep "Fitting error" si_alm2.log
  Fitting error (%) : 0.567187

The other file :red:`si222.xml` contains crystal structure, symmetry, IFCs, and all other information necessary for subsequent phonon calculations.


.. _tutorial_Si_step4:

4. Calculate phonon dispersion and phonon DOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the file :red:`si_phband.in` and edit it for your system.

.. literalinclude:: ../../example/Si/si_phband.in

Please specify the XML file you obtained in step 3 by the ``FCSXML``-tag as above. 
In the **&cell**-field, you need to define the lattice vector of a **primitive cell**.
In phonon dispersion calculations, the first entry in the **&kpoint**-field should be 1 (**KPMODE** = 1).

Then, execute **anphon**
::
    
    $ anphon si_phband.in > si_phband.log

which creates a file :red:`si222.bands` in the working directory.
In this file, phonon frequencies along the given reciprocal path are printed in units of cm\ :sup:`-1` as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../example/Si/reference/si222.bands
   :lines: 1-10

You can plot the phonon dispersion relation with gnuplot or any other plot software.

For visualizing phonon dispersion relations, we provide a Python script :red:`plotband.py` in the tools/ directory 
(Matplotlib is required.). Try
::  
    
    $ python plotband.py si222.bands

Then, the phonon dispersion is displayed as follows:

.. image:: ../img/Si_phband_DFT.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center

You can save the figure as png, eps, or other formats from this window.
You can also change the energy unit of phonon frequency from cm\ :sup:`-1` to THz or meV by the ``--unit`` option. 
For more detail of the usage of :red:`plotband.py`, type
::

   $ python plotband.py -h

Next, let us calculate the phonon DOS. Copy :red:`si_phband.in` to :red:`si_phdos.in` and edit the **&kpoint** field as follows::

    &kpoint
      2  # KPMODE = 2: uniform mesh mode
      20 20 20
    /

Then, execute **anphon**
::
    
    $ anphon si_phdos.in > si_phdos.log

This time, **anphon** creates files :red:`si222.dos` and :red:`si222.thermo` in the working directory, 
which contain phonon DOS and thermodynamic functions, respectively.
For visualizing phonon DOS and projected DOSs, we provide a Python script :red:`plotdos.py` in the tools/ directory (Matplotlib is required.).
The command 
::

    $ python plotdos.py --emax 550 --nokey si222.dos

will show the phonon DOS of Si by a pop-up window:

.. image:: ../img/Si_phdos_DFT.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center

To improve the resolution of DOS, try again with a denser :math:`k` grid and a smaller ``DELTA_E`` value.


.. _tutorial_Si_step5:

5. Estimate cubic IFCs for thermal conductivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy file :red:`si_alm.in` to :red:`si_alm2.in`. 
Edit the **&general**, **&interaction**, and **&cutoff** fields of :red:`si_alm2.in` as the following::

    &general
      PREFIX = si222_cubic
      MODE = suggest
      NAT = 64; NKD = 1
      KD = Si
    /

Change the ``PREFIX`` from *si222* to *si222_cubic* and set ``MODE`` to *suggest*.

::

    &interaction
      NORDER = 2
    /

Change the ``NORDER`` tag from ``NORDER = 1`` to ``NORDER = 2`` to include cubic IFCs. 
Here, we consider cubic interaction pairs up to second nearest neighbors by specifying the cutoff radii as::

    &cutoff
      Si-Si None 7.3
    /

7.3 Bohr is slightly larger than the distance of second nearest neighbors (7.21461 Bohr). 
Change the cutoff value appropriately for your own case. (Atomic distance can be found in the file :red:`si_alm.log`.)

Then, execute **alm**
::

    $ alm si_alm2.in > si_alm2.log

which creates files si222_cubic.pattern_HARMONIC and :red:`si222_cubic.pattern_ANHARM3`.

Then, calculate atomic forces of displaced configurations given in the file :red:`si222_cubic.pattern_ANHARM3`, and collect the displacement (force) data to a file :red:`disp3.dat` (:red:`force3.dat`) as you did for harmonic IFCs in Steps 3 and 4.

.. Note::
    Since making :red:`disp3.dat` and :red:`force3.dat` requires moderate computational resources, you can skip this procedure by copying files :red:`reference/disp3.dat` and :red:`reference/force3.dat` to the working directory. The files we provide were generated by the Quantum-ESPRESSO package with ``--mag=0.04``.


In :red:`si_alm2.in`, change ``MODE = suggest`` to ``MODE = fitting`` and add the following::

    &fitting
      NDATA = 20
      DFILE = disp3.dat
      FFILE = force3.dat
      FC2XML = si222.xml # Fix harmonic IFCs
    /

By the ``FC2XML`` tag, harmonic IFCs are fixed to the values in :red:`si222.xml`.
Then, execute **alm** again
::

    $ alm si_alm2.in > si_alm2.log2

which creates files :red:`si222_cubic.fcs` and :red:`si222_cubic.xml`. This time cubic IFCs are also included in these files.

.. Note::
    In the above example, we obtained cubic IFCs by least square fitting with harmonic IFCs being fixed to the value of the previous harmonic calculation. You can also estimate both harmonic and cubic IFCs simultaneously instead. To do this, merge :red:`disp.dat` and :red:`disp3.dat` ( and force files) as
    ::

        $ cat disp.dat disp3.dat > disp_merged.dat
        $ cat force.dat force3.dat > force_merged.dat

    and change the **&fitting** field as the following::

        &fitting
          NDATA = 21
          DFILE = disp_merged.dat
          FFILE = force_merged.dat
        /


.. _tutorial_Si_step6:


6. Calculate thermal conductivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy file :red:`si_phdos.in` to :red:`si_RTA.in` and edit the ``MODE`` and ``FCSXML`` tags as follows::

    &general
      PREFIX = si222
      MODE = RTA
      FCSXML = si222_cubic.xml

      NKD = 1; KD = Si
      MASS = 28.0855
    /

In addition, change the :math:`k` grid density as::

    &kpoint
      2
      10 10 10
    /

Then, execute **anphon** as a background job
::

    $ anphon si_RTA.in > si_RTA.log &

Please be patient. This can take a while. 
When the job finishes, you can find a file :red:`si222.kl` in which the lattice thermal conductivity is saved.
You can plot this file using gnuplot (or any other plotting softwares) as follows::

    $ gnuplot
    gnuplot> set logscale xy
    gnuplot> set xlabel "Temperature (K)"
    gnuplot> set ylabel "Lattice thermal conductivity (W/mK)"
    gnuplot> plot "si222.kl" usi 1:2 w lp

.. figure:: ../img/si_kappa.png
   :scale: 40%
   :align: center

   Calculated lattice thermal conductivity of Si (click to enlarge)

As you can see, the thermal conductivity diverges in :math:`T\rightarrow 0` limit. 
This occurs because we only considered intrinsic phonon-phonon scatterings in the present calculation and
neglected phonon-boundary scatterings which are dominant in the low-temperature range.
The effect of the boundary scattering can be included using the python script ``analyze_phonons.py`` in the tools directory::

    $ analyze_phonons.py --calc kappa_boundary --size 1.0e+6 si222.result > si222_boundary_1mm.kl

In this script, the phonon lifetimes are altered using the Matthiessen's rule

.. math::

  \frac{1}{\tau_{q}^{total}} = \frac{1}{\tau_{q}^{p-p}} + \frac{2|\boldsymbol{v}_{q}|}{L}.

Here, the first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the scattering rate due to 
the phonon-phonon scattering and the second term is the scattering rate due to a grain boundary of size :math:`L`.
The size :math:`L` must be specified using the ``--size`` option in units of nm. The result is also shown in the
above figure and the divergence is cured with the boundary effect.

.. Note::
    When a calculation is performed with a smearing method (``ISMEAR=0 or 1``) instead of the
    tetrahedron method (``ISMEAR=-1``), the thermal conductivity may have a peak structure in the very low-temperature region even without the boundary effect. This peak occurs because of the finite smearing width :math:`\epsilon` used in the smearing methods. As we decrease the :math:`\epsilon` value, the peak value of :math:`\kappa` should disappear. In addition, a very dense :math:`q` grid is necessary for describing phonon excitations and thermal transport in the low-temperature region (regardless of the ``ISMEAR`` value).


.. _tutorial_Si_step7:

7. Analyze results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to analyze the result for better understandings of nanoscale thermal transport.
Some selected features are introduced below:

Phonon lifetime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file :red:`si222.result` contains phonon linewidths at irreducible :math:`k` points. 
You can extract phonon lifetime from this file as follows::

    $ analyze_phonons.py --calc tau --temp 300 si222.result > tau300K_10.dat
    $ gnuplot
    gnuplot> set xrange [1:]
    gnuplot> set logscale y
    gnuplot> set xlabel "Phonon frequency (cm^{-1})"
    gnuplot> set ylabel "Phonon lifetime (ps)"
    gnuplot> plot "tau300K_10.dat" using 3:4 w p

.. figure:: ../img/si_tau.png
   :scale: 40%
   :align: center

   Phonon lifetime of Si at 300 K (click to enlarge)

In the above figure, phonon lifetimes calculated with :math:`20\times 20\times 20\ q` points are also shown by open circles. 


Cumulative thermal conductivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following the procedure below, you can obtain the :ref:`cumulative thermal conductivity <cumulative_kappa>`::

    $ analyze_phonons.py --calc cumulative --temp 300 --length 10000:5 si222.result > cumulative_300K_10.dat
    $ gnuplot
    gnuplot> set logscale x
    gnuplot> set xlabel "L (nm)"
    gnuplot> set ylabel "Cumulative kappa (W/mK)"
    gnuplot> plot "cumulative_300K_10.dat" using 1:2 w lp

.. figure:: ../img/si_cumulative.png
   :scale: 40%
   :align: center

   Cumulative thermal conductivity of Si at 300 K (click to enlarge)

To draw a smooth line, you will have to use a denser :math:`q` grid as shown in the figure by the orange line,
which are obtained with :math:`20\times 20\times 20\ q` points.

Thermal conductivity spectrum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To calculate the :ref:`spectrum of thermal conductivity <kappa>`, modify the :red:`si_RTA.in` as follows::

    &general
      PREFIX = si222
      MODE = RTA
      FCSXML = si222_cubic.xml

      NKD = 1; KD = Si
      MASS = 28.0855
  
      EMIN = 0; EMAX = 550; DELTA_E = 1.0 # <-- frequency range
    /

    &cell
    10.203
     0.0 0.5 0.5
     0.5 0.0 0.5
     0.5 0.5 0.0
    /

    &kpoint
     2
     10 10 10
    /

    &analysis
     KAPPA_SPEC = 1 # compute spectrum of kappa
    /

The frequency range is specified with the ``EMIN``, ``EMAX``, and ``DELTA_E`` tags, and the ``KAPPA_SPEC = 1`` is set in the ``&analysis`` field. Then, execute anphon again
::

    $ anphon si_RTA.in > si_RTA2.log 

After the calculation finishes, you can find the file :red:`si222.kl_spec` which contains the spectra of thermal conductivity at various temperatures. You can plot the data at room temperature as follows::
    
    $ awk '{if ($1 == 300.0) print $0}' si222.kl_spec > si222_300K_10.kl_spec
    $ gnuplot
    gnuplot> set xlabel "Frequency (cm^{-1})"
    gnuplot> set ylabel "Spectrum of kappa (W/mK/cm^{-1})"
    gnuplot> plot "si222_300K_10.kl_spec" using 2:3 w l lt 2 lw 2

.. figure:: ../img/si_kappa_spec.png
   :scale: 40%
   :align: center

   Spectrum of thermal conductivity of Si at 300 K (click to enlarge)


In the above figure, the computational result with :math:`20\times 20\times 20\ q` points is also shown by dashed line. 
From the figure, we can see that low-energy phonons below 200 cm\ :math:`^{-1}` account for more than 80% of the total thermal conductivity at 300 K.
